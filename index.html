            <h3>About me:-
                
                
                I try to be passionate about my dreams and hobbies, live honestly, and work hard to achieve all that I want to make. I am a grey hat coder who lives in Hyderabad city with my family.
                There are many things I have to learn and want to learn. The first thing that I want to learn is cooking. The number of things I can make in the kitchen is limited. However, while making those things, I realize the happiness and satisfaction are get from cooking. Also knowing how to cook dishes in the kitchen will make me happy.
                I have also been very fond of coding because I can do it where ever i want and after seeing the change after just writing a few lines of code always seems to make me happy.
                I also want to lean the coding language "Lua" as one platform called roblox uses it to create 3D games and i always see many people making so many games and they also make money by making such simple yet fun games and that made me also want to create some games but i cant because i dont know how to script in it yet.
